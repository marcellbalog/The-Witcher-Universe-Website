								<h1>Short story: The Last Wish</h1>
								<p>One morning, while trying to catch fish for breakfast, Dandelion and Geralt instead haul up an ancient, sealed amphora. Dandelion, in a fit of glee, and ignoring Geralt's explicit warnings, tries to opens the vase. During a struggle between the two the vase falls to the ground and a large cloud of red mist escapes—a genie (or djinn, more accurately). Geralt dives for cover, but Dandelion feels he knows exactly what is happening and holds his ground, beginning to recite his list of three wishes. The genie does not fulfil even the first one of the bard's wishes (that his rival die of apoplexy), opting instead to strangle the bard.</p>
								<div id="b1more-t" class="story-text-more">
									<p>Geralt rushes to his friend's rescue, and after a seemingly fruitless fight, decides to use some folk knowledge he had always considered to be nonsense. The witcher seizes the amphora seal which has fallen to the ground and shouts out an exorcism. The genie releases the bard and disappears across the river, but Dandelion is far from well. It seems his throat and larynx have been seriously affected by the djinn and he needs help desperately.</p>

									<p>After a day's ride, they arrive at the gates of Rinde, but are told that no one may pass through the gates between dusk and dawn without a letter of safe conduct from the king or proof of nobility. The guard offers them the gatehouse until morning, pointing out that Dandelion will fare better there than out of doors. Having no other option, the witcher agrees.</p>

									<p>Waiting for the dawn to break, Geralt makes the acquaintance of two elves Chireadan and his cousin, Errdil and a half-elf knight, Vratimir. They inform him that there are heavy duties and penalties for spellcasting within the city, and the mages are boycotting Rinde in return. There is one though, who continues to work her magic within the city limits and generally flouts the law: the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, residing in the sanctuary provided by the Novigradian merchant-ambassador, Beau Berrant.</p>

									<p>When dawn breaks, Geralt enters the city to find the sorceress. Arriving at Beau Berrant's home, he is greeted by Cerberus, the doorman of sorts. After a fruitless discussion, Geralt decides that perhaps gold might open the door and knocks the oaf unconscious with his money purse. Once inside he drags Cerberus into an open room where one of the female staff is happily snoring away. The witcher then proceeds to the basement where he meets a very inebriated Berrant. The ambassador, it seems, is on a mission to get apple juice for his guest and asks Geralt for help. Geralt fetches the juice only to find Beau unconscious.</p>

									<p>Noticing a staircase nearby, the witcher climbs up to what turns out to be Yennefer's bedchamber. The sorceress is asleep but when Geralt wakes her she immediately asks him leave. Geralt is able to convince Yennefer to help Dandelion, right after a bath. While Yennefer takes a bath, Geralt is amazed by her beauty, but also realizes that it is probably a spell, as most girls who become sorceresses are ugly or malformed by nature. He puts these thoughts aside, and decides to just enjoy her beauty, as they talk over Dandelion's condition. Once dressed, Yennefer opens a portal and the two set out for the tavern where Dandelion is laid up.</p>

									<p>Back at Errdil's inn, Chireadan and Geralt sit downstairs waiting to hear about the bard's condition and chatting a little about Yennefer over a cup of herb tea. Chireadan tells Geralt in no uncertain terms that Yennefer, while beautiful, is not to be trusted.</p>

									<p>After a while, Yennefer summons Geralt upstairs; Dandelion is happily, safely asleep, and there is only the question of price to be discussed. Geralt first wants to take Dandelion to safety, and offers a price to guarantee his return. Yennefer wants her price right away though, and reveals that she has in fact trapped Geralt in the room. The witcher is completely paralyzed. After a rather fruitless argument, Geralt passes out and the next thing Geralt knows, he is sharing the cell with "honest thieves", an innocent old man and Chireadan.</p>

									<p>The elf tells Geralt the reason for their presence there: under the influence of Yennefer's spell, Geralt went rampaging through the town, punishing anyone who had ever insulted Yennefer. The local apothecary Laurelnose was actually publicly spanked by the witcher for his "crimes". As the two men reflect on their situation, their musings are rudely interrupted by the entrance of three guards. One of them starts taunting Geralt while his friends hold the witcher still, then proceeds to repeatedly punch the witcher in the stomach. Seeking to get out with the least injuries possible, Geralt tries to goad the man into rendering him unconscious. He expresses the wish that the man simply burst, and to everyone's surprise, the guard does so.</p>

									<p>Later, the witcher and the elf are brought before the town's mayor, Neville and the priest Krepp. The mayor is not happy with the situation, but before he can reach a verdict, Dandelion suddenly drops into the room from a magical portal which suddenly appears on the wall. The bard shouts with a fully restored voice that he wishes everyone present to believe that the witcher is innocent. He was instructed to do this by Yennefer, who sent him through this portal to use his last wish so the genie would be freed and she could capture it.</p>

									<p>Dandelion has hardly had time to explain himself, when a roaring commotion is heard outside, loud enough to be heard over the current thunderstorm. Rushing to the window, the group sees that Yennefer has lured the genie to the town, and is trying to capture it to gain its amazing powers. The genie is much stronger then expected though, and despite Yennefer's spells binding it to Errdil's inn, the genie is trashing the town. Geralt realises that the genie was fulfilling HIS wishes, not Dandelion's, since he was the one holding the seal last. His first wish was the incantation he used on the genie and his second was the wish for the guard to burst, and thus the genie is still awaiting Geralt's third wish. Because the genie still has to fulfil his master's last wish, he is not yet freed, and is thus not able to be captured by Yennefer.</p>

									<p>Geralt ushers everyone else to safety, and asks Krepp to stabilize the trace of the portal Dandelion just fell through. After a few protests, the priest obliges and the portal reappears. Geralt jumps through, intent on saving the sorceress. Yennefer does not want to be saved though, she is not done trapping her genie and resists Geralt's help, even opening a portal to get rid of him. While he falls into the portal however, the witcher grabs Yennefer, and the sorceress is dragged into the portal with him. When they exit the portal, Yennefer immediately shakes off Geralt and goes back through the portal, Geralt following her close behind.</p>

									<p>Outside, the people gathered are watching in terror as the genie continues to rampage through the city. After a scuffle between Yennefer and Geralt, with waning powers, the sorceress traps Geralt. The witcher finally succeeds in explaining the situation and Yennefer demands that he make his last wish, saying that he could have anything. While rethinking his wish, Geralt realises what Yennefer looked like before she became a sorceress - she was a hunchback. Then, he decides on his last wish.</p>

									<p>The next moment, the genie tears free, the inn collapses and silence descends upon the village. Under the rubble of the inn, Yennefer finds herself in Geralt's arms, close and intimate. Just moments later, Yennefer and Geralt begin to make love in the remains of what was the beginning of a stormy relationship.</p>

								<h1>Short story: The Sword of Destiny</h1>
								<p>While on his way to Brokilon to deliver a message to the queen of the dryads, Eithné, from King Venzlav of Brugge, Geralt stumbles upon the body of a boy, probably no more than fifteen. The boy has been killed by an obviously expertly delivered arrow which can still be seen protruding from his skull.</p>

								<p>Experience quickly makes it clear to the witcher what has happened: the boy had obviously strayed into territory claimed by the dryads. Like others who had suffered similar fates before, the scenario had likely been the same.</p>
								<div id="b2more-t" class="story-text-more">

									<p>	Warning shot. Human! Not one step further!</p>
									<p>	The boy, probably panicked, ran the wrong way, further into the dryad's domain</p>
									<p>	Another shot. This second shot, not a warning</p>
									<p>	A sad tale, too often repeated.</p>

									<p>He hurries his pace, hoping to catch up with the people he has been following and convince them to turn back. Too late. He finds a second body, an adult male, and then a third. Then he hears a rustling noise. Locating its source, he discovers, much to his surprise, Freixenet. Freixenet is in bad shape, but his only concern seems to be that Geralt find "the princess".</p>

									<p>As he tries to extract the large man from his hiding place, another arrow whizzes by narrowly missing the witcher's own head, then more. They are surrounded by dryads. Geralt realizes he has no choice but to surrender if there is any hope of surviving the encounter. He explains the original purpose of his unannounced arrival in Brokilon and manages to convince them that he must still speak with Eithné. They agree to escort him the rest of the way, and assign one of their ranks, Braenn to be his guide. He is immediately sent on his way and not permitted to speak with Freixenet again nor told what will happen to the man.</p>

									<p>Geralt and Braenn then set off through the forest, on their way to Duén Canell. Along the way they come upon a giant centipede which seems to be threatening a halfling. Springing into action, the witcher tackles the beast. With the help of Braenn, they eventually dispatch the monster, only to realize that its intended victim was no halfling, but a little human girl, no more than 10 years old, the princess Cirilla of Cintra herself.</p>

									<p>Realizing they cannot leave her there alone, the witcher and the dryad decide to take her with them. It is during this latter part of their journey that Geralt and Ciri get to know each other a little. It seems that Ciri had been sent to meet a prospective suitor, prince Kistrin, son of king Ervyll of Verden, by her grandmother, Calanthe. Ciri, however, had other ideas and ran away. Freixenet and his unfortunate party had been trying to find her to bring her back when they were ambushed by dryads.</p>

									<p>Finally the trio arrive at the heart of Brokilon, Duén Canell, where they also find Freixenet. Although still a prisoner, his wounds are being treated by the dryads and he already seems a good deal better. The two men finally get a chance to speak and Freixenet fills Geralt in on the rest of the details of Ciri's adventure so far.</p>

									<p>During the journey it has become increasingly clear that, this being Brokilon, Ciri will likely never be permitted to leave. So now, in addition to his original message, Geralt must now speak with Eithné about Ciri's fate as well. The queen of the dryads is proud and determined, not to mention particularly unsympathetic towards the humans who have relegated her people to one tiny patch of forest.</p>

									<p>Ultimately, Eithné allows Ciri to choose her own fate and Ciri chooses the witcher. The queen also decides to spare Freixenet on the basis that he is an acquaintance of Geralt and that he did not have the intention of hunting dryads when he trespassed into the forest. After all, dryads still need males to make new dryads, so it seems that the large man will become a stud.</p>

									<p>Back on his original route to Brugge, the witcher and his newest companion are surrounded by what seem to be a group of Verden soldiers. One of the group explains that what they have come upon is the scene of a dryad ambush of a merchant caravan. But Geralt quickly notices that the evidence around him does not support the claims being made by the "soldiers" and a fight ensues. Ciri manages to hide in a tree but the witcher is hopelessly outnumbered. Luckily, and at the last minute, he is saved by the arrival of Mousesack and some dryads.</p>

									<p>The new party of three then continue on the road together as Geralt and Mousesack catch up with each other's news. The witcher then leaves Ciri in the care of her "uncle" Mousesack and continues on his way, much to the chagrin of the young girl.</p>

								<p>The Empire of Nilfgaard attacks the Kingdom of Cintra. Queen Calanthe commits suicide and her granddaughter, Cirilla, called Ciri and nicknamed the "Lion Cub of Cintra" manages to flee from the burning capital city. Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard, sends his spies to find her. He knows that this young girl has great importance, not only because of her royal blood, but also because of her magical potential and elven blood in her veins.</p>

								<p>The girl is being protected by Geralt of Rivia, a witcher - a magically and genetically mutated monster slayer for hire, who takes her to the witchers' keep - Kaer Morhen. There, Ciri is being taught by the other witchers, including old Vesemir, Coën, Eskel and Lambert. She learns about monsters and how to fight them. She is taught to fight with a sword in the witcher style. But during her "education", the sorceress Triss Merigold comes to Kaer Morhen. She is called by Geralt to help with occasional strange and abnormal behavior he has seen in Ciri. Triss realises that Ciri is a Source. She acknowledges that she does not have the power to control Ciri's talent, and advises Geralt to swallow his pride and seek help with Yennefer, a more experienced sorceress and his former lover...</p>
								
								<div id="b3more-t" class="story-text-more">
									<p>At the same time, a mysterious wizard called Rience is looking for the girl. He is a servant of a more powerful mage, who remains unknown. He captures Geralt's friend, Dandelion the bard, and tortures him for information about Ciri. Dandelion is saved by the timely arrival of Yennefer, who engages in a short magic combat with Rience. Rience manages to escape through a portal opened by his master, but left with a prominent facial scar from Yennefer's spell.</p>

									<p>In the spring, Geralt leaves Kaer Morhen with Triss and Ciri, intending to deliver Ciri to the Temple School in Ellander where she would receive a "normal" education from Nenneke. On the way, Triss falls ill, and they join Yarpen Zigrin's dwarven company who is guarding a caravan for King Henselt. Geralt tells Ciri about the roses of Aelirenn, an elf who died leading the elven youths to fight the humans. The caravan is attacked by the Scoia'tael, and it is revealed that the escort mission was a trap set by the kings who doubted Yarpen's loyalty.</p>

									<p>Ciri's stay in Ellander is still haunted by disturbing dreams until the arrival of Yennefer, who starts educating her in the ways of magic. From an initial antagonism, their relationship develops into a strong and deep bond, like that of a mother and daughter.</p>

									<p>Meanwhile, Geralt does his best to track Rience and his mysterious employer. With the help of Dandelion and Shani, he forces a confrontation with Rience, during which both are injured. Rience's master intervenes again, opening a portal for him, and Geralt is prevented from pursuing the mage by Philippa Eilhart, who also kills the last surviving of the Michelet brothers so as not to provide Geralt any source of information which might eventually reveal the mysterious mage. Eilhart then leaves behind a wounded Geralt.</p>

									<p>Yennefer became Ciri's mentor and teacher. As they are about to leave the Temple School in Ellander, Yennefer asks Ciri whether she didn't like her at first, leading to a series of flashbacks detailing Ciri's studies with Yennefer from the day they were introduced and back to the present as they are about to leave the Temple. And Ciri responds by admitting the she didn't like her at first, but it quickly changed, they both bonded together, afterwards they leave.</p>

								<p>The story begins where Blood of Elves left off, essentially with Ciri and Yennefer having just left the Temple in Ellander, on their way to Gors Velen, and ultimately Thanedd Island. It is Yennefer's intention that Ciri be enrolled at Aretuza and that she continue her instruction in the use and mastery of magic.</p> 

								<p>Once they arrive in Gors Velen, Yennefer goes to see her old friend Giancardi Molnar, a dwarven banker. The latter informs the sorceress that her financial movements are being tracked, something Yennefer already suspected, but he arranges an essentially unlimited line of credit for her and makes several financial transfers to cover expenses for Ciri's education. He and Yennefer also agree to allow Ciri to see the sights, escorted by one of Molnar's faithful employees, Fabio Sachs.</p>

								<p>While on their excursion, things get quickly out of hand after a Wyvern being held as a sideshow breaks free of its cage, and Ciri uses a magical amulet given to her by Yennefer in case of emergency. Because those who understand magic can sense when magic is being used, Ciri is noticed by two sorceresses. She is mistaken for one of about a dozen students who have recently "escaped" from Aretuza in the kerfuffle leading up to the mages' conference being held there. She is apprehended by no less than the former and current headmistresses of the academy, Tissaia de Vries and Margarita (Rita) Laux-Antille. At first, the sorceresses do not believe Ciri's story, but ultimately, the girl and Fabio manage to convince the headmistresses to check out their story at the bank and things are quickly confirmed by Yennefer and Giancardi. The three sorceresses then decide to discuss events over at the Silver Heron, taking Ciri with them and leaving poor Fabio to deal with his employer...</p>
								<div id="b4more-t" class="story-text-more">
									<p>At the inn, Tissaia and Rita have rented the entire cellar which is actually a bath house and the four "ladies" retire there to relax and chat. It seems that both Rita and Tissaia, but especially Rita have every intention of getting good and drunk and Ciri is dispatched to refill their caraff of wine not very long after it arrives.</p>

									<p>While getting the refreshments, Ciri notices a mercenary (Rayla) who orders the innkeeper to open a back door for her — a door which leads directly to the outer walls of the city, bypassing the usual gates and guards. On her second trip to refill the caraff, Ciri uses her new found knowledge and runs away to see Geralt whom she has been told is at Hirundum, not far from Gors Velen. Yennefer, luckily is not far behind. Ciri's flight does, however, provide Geralt and Yennefer with an opportunity to meet up again and to patch things in their relationship before the three set off for Thanedd Island together.</p>

									<p>On the island, things are in a tizzy. The girls have been temporarily moved from their usual accommodation within Aretuza to Loxia, the lowest level of the complex as the school itself is being used to accommodate the visiting sorcerers and sorceresses. That evening, Yennefer takes Geralt as her date to the reception, leaving Ciri in her room and ensuring that there is no second flight with magic.</p>

									<p>At the reception, Geralt meets quite a few interesting individuals, but in particular he meets Vilgefortz for the first time. The mage is considered very young (which of course is anything less than 100 years to mages, but he looks more like 35), he is also considered to be particularly talented, but as Geralt finds out, his road to becoming a mage was not exactly the usual route. The wizard was abandoned as a baby and taken in and raised by druids. It was only as an adult that he became a mage. A point he underlines with some emphasis to the witcher. He even goes so far as to try to encourage Geralt to become a mage himself, but the witcher refuses.</p>

									<p>Dijkstra also tries to recruit the witcher to no avail.</p>

									<p>After the reception, Yennefer and Geralt retire to their room and re-connect on a more intimate level. After a very fruitful reunion and a bit of sleep, the witcher is awakened by an urge to urinate, but in deference to his hosts, decides against relieving himself in the flower pots outside the window and decides to find the courtyard. This is when he stumbles upon the coup, already taking place. Philippa Eilhart and Dijkstra, a sorceress and spy working for the King of Redania, organizes the coup and plans to reveal the mages working for Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard.</p>

									<p>In the ensuing confusion we find out that Yennefer had brought Ciri before the Chapter on the request of Tissaia and the girl begins to prophesize. Ciri reveals the asssasination of the King of Redania the night before and that Demavend, king of Aedirn has preemptively started an attack on Nilfgaard. The Northern Kings' interest in waging war against the scoia'tael combined with Ciri's revelations infuriates Tissaia, who is against such violence. She inactivates the barrier of casting spells in the school and sides with Vilgefortz in the matter, leading to a deadly battle among mages.</p>

									<p>In the meantime Geralt escapes from Dijkstra and rushes in to save Yennefer and Ciri at the school. In the ensuring chaos Yennefer and Geralt fight the invading scoi'tael supporting Vilgefortz, while Ciri flees from the scene. The Black Rider plaguing Ciri's dreams turns out to be a Nilfgaardian soldier that tried to escort Ciri out of Cintra to safety. Geralt finally faces Vilgefortz, who makes him an offer to join him to his side under Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. Geralt refuses and a fight ensues in which Geralt is soundly defeated. Tissaia finally realizes her mistake and along with Triss Merigold's help, takes Geralt to safety.</p>

									<p>Emperor Emhyr var Emreis wanted the Chapter of Mages to be broken apart since the sorcerers and mages were the reason for his loss at the battle of Sodden Hill. The break up of the Chapter and the incoming war breaks Tissaia and she commits suicide. Soon after the events at Thanedd Island, a full blown war erupts with Nilfgaard advancing to the north. King Demavend escapes to Redania while Aedirn, Rivia, and Vengerberg soundly falls to Emhyr's grasps. King Foltest of Temeria forms a deal with Emhyr and avoids war on Temeria at the moment. In the meantime Emhyr manages to find a fake Ciri and publically announces his plans to marry her, thus appearing as the rightful king to Cintra.</p>

									<p>Ciri escapes via a portal in Tor Lara, also known as the Gulls' Tower, during Geralt's fight with Vilgefortz. She awakens in Korath desert known to many as the 'frying pan' and barely manages to stay alive, thanks to the help of a unicorn, whom she names "Little Horse". When pushed for survival, she relies on her magical abilities involving fire, which invokes more nightmares and hallucinations that forcefully entices her to take revenge on those who abandoned her, which leaves her scarred and promising herself to avoid fire as a source of power.</p>

									<p>After escaping the desert, she is captured by bounty hunters of Nilfgaard and manages to escape from them with the help of bandits known as the Rats. She feels safe and gains a sense of belonging among the group as the members faced a similar harsh reality of being abandoned during the times of contempt. Through her skills she learned in Kaer Morhen she impresses the group, which gains her the name Falka. The book also expands on Ciri's prophecy as the bearer of Elder Blood, where it is revealed that she holds great power and her son will herald a new age, following the destruction of the old.</p>

The witcher, accompanied by Dandelion and the young woman he meets in Brokilon, undertake a dangerous journey, meeting new people along the way and discovering the truth about the mysterious Black Rider who has been plaguing Ciri's dreams. One of the new friends they make along the way turns out to be rather interesting...</p>

								<p>While recovering in Brokilon from his injuries sustained during the Thanedd coup, Geralt meets Milva, a hunter and expert archer. Her mastery of the bow is unequalled. Despite not particularly liking the convalescing witcher, she decides to follow Geralt, who is accompanied by Dandelion, on his way towards Nilfgaard and hopefully, Ciri. The journey is not easy, the war is encroaching seemingly from all directions and nearly every city is ablaze.</p>

								<p>Along their journey they meet a group of dwarves led by one Zoltan Chivay. As it seems they are all going in the same direction, Geralt's party joins the group who are also shepherding some refugee women and children...</p>
								<div id="b5more-t" class="story-text-more">
									<p>At several points in their journey, Geralt and his companions come across Cahir, the erstwhile "Black Rider" that plagued Ciri's dreams. Initially, the knight is being transported as a prisoner by some hawkers, when Geralt spares his life for the second time. However, the witcher wants nothing to do with the young Nilfgaardian and leaves him to his own devices, Cahir is ever persistent and continues to shadow the witcher and his entourage. Eventually, through Milva's intervention, the young knight comes to join the group.</p>

									<p>Finally, the troupe is joined by Regis, a vampire, some might say "monster", who rather surprisingly becomes the monster hunter's good friend. Regis proves invaluable for his medical skills.</p>

									<p>As the group travels east, they are inevitably caught between the warring factions which leads them into the thick of the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga where the group is pivotal in queen Meve's victory. Geralt had previously named himself "Geralt of Rivia" for credibility sake, however, it is shortly after this battle that Geralt is coincidentally knighted by the queen and officially becomes "Geralt of Rivia".</p>

									<p>Meanwhile, Ciri has settled into life with a party of young rebels who call themselves the Rats and has become known as "Falka". With the Rats, she experiences killing on quite a regular basis, but also forms a strong bond with Mistle. Killing ultimately becomes an obsession for the former princess.</p>

									<p>Another background story revolves around the formation of the Lodge of Sorceresses. It turns out that Francesca Findabair managed to capture and compress Yennefer into a jade figurine following the events at Thanedd Island. It appears that the Lodge is very keen on using Ciri to their advantage in controlling the politics and prioritizing magic, which leads them to indirectly force Yennefer into joining their group. One Nilfgaardian sorceress, Fringilla Vigo, manages to help Yennefer escape from one of the Lodge meetings to rescue Ciri.</p>

								<p>One day, old Vysogota finds a very badly injured girl in the swamp surrounding his retreat. He saves her life and she tells him her story... the story of Ciri and how she became a cruel killer meeting death at every step. Until she met her retribution - Leo Bonhart, who killed her fellow bandits and captured her.</p>

								<p>Meanwhile, Geralt is on his way to find Druids who might know where Ciri is. But someone is determined that the witcher should not find her...</p>

								<p>Vysogota, an old philosopher living in the Pereplut swamp, finds an injured Ciri near his retreat and takes her in, caring for her until she is ready to continue her journey. She tells her life story to the old man: how all the Rats were killed by Leo Bonhart, all except for Ciri. As she readies herself to leave, she is convinced that both Geralt and Yennefer are dead. Based on this assumption, she leaves Vysogota to find Tor Zireael.</p>

								<p>Meanwhile, Geralt meets an elf named Avallac'h who tells him about a prophecy connected with Ciri. He needs to find some druids who will reportedly know where Ciri is. Yennefer is trying to find Vilgefortz's hiding place, but it is no easy task.</p>

							<div class="story-art-text">
								<p>After walking through the portal in Tor Zireael while narrowly escaping death, Ciri finds herself in a completely different world... an Elven world. She is trapped there with no apparent way out. Time does not seem to exist and there are no obvious borders or portals to cross back into her home world.</p>

								<p>But this is Ciri, the child of prophecy, and she will not be defeated. She knows she must escape to finally rejoin the Witcher, Geralt, and his companions - and also to try to conquer her worst nightmare. Leo Bonhart, the man who chased, wounded and tortured Ciri, is still on her trail. And the world is still at war.</p>

								<p>The story opens with Ciri bathing in a pond in an unknown world. As she does so, Sir Galahad of the Arthurian legend stumbles upon her. After mistaking her for the Lady of the Lake, they then talk and Ciri recounts her story.</p>

								<p>The story cuts to a point in time that takes place after the story, where a young maiden, Condwiramurs, meets the Lady of the Lake to study the legend of Geralt and Ciri. They do so through intense study of the pictures portraying the characters and events from the story, which they then dream of. Eventually Condwiramurs starts to dream of the events at the behest of the Lady of the Lake. Her first dream is that of Stefan Skellen and Leo Bonhart, who are revealed to be working for Vilgefortz and have imprisoned Yennefer...</p>
								<div id="b7more-t" class="story-text-more">
									<p>The dream ends and a new dream starts, this time dealing with the adventures of Geralt. Geralt has been completing monster contracts in the Beauclair city of Toussaint while the rest of the group, Dandelion, Regis, Milva, Angouleme, and Cahir, have been exploring and relaxing. Geralt eventually starts a relationship with the castle sorceress, Fringilla. Fringilla is one of the few members of the Lodge, a group of sorceresses that wish to control the political world, and is assigned the task of delaying him to seek out Yennefer and Ciri. Geralt eventually receives a contract to investigate and potentially kill several monsters which live in an abandoned castle near the city of Touissant. While accomplishing the task, he overhears Skellen, Bonhart, and several other associates talk about where Vilgefortz and Yennefer are located and how Ciri is missing. Geralt rushes back to Touissant in order to gather his group and leave to save Yennefer.</p>

									<p>Ciri is shown to have arrived in a foreign world after entering the portal at the Tower of the Swallow. This world appears to be ruled by elves, whom live in peace except for occasional fights with the unicorns. She meets with several elves, notably Avallac'h and Eredin Bréacc Glas, who is the leader of a cavalry unit called Dearg Ruadhri and reveals that the unicorns have become restless since she entered their world. She is told she must bear the child of their king, Auberon, who appears to be addicted to fisstech and is emotionally cold. Despite her disgruntlement with the situation, she agrees. After several fruitless nights, she confronts the other elves of the castle and demands that she be let go, as it appears their king is not interested in her, and that she wants to return to her friends. She is told that time happens differently in this world, and that once her task is accomplished she will be returned to her time. Eventually Eredin confronts her, giving her a vial and hinting that she should poison Auberon.</p>

									<p>In a bout of frustration, she rides her horse, Kelpie, as far away as possible from the castle, despite the warnings that barriers prevent her from leaving the place. As she is riding she is cornered by several unicorns, who threaten to kill her, fearing her power. She is spared, as one of the unicorns, Ihuarraquax, she had saved from death earlier. The unicorns then reveal how she can bypass the barriers. She finds Auberon dead from overdose and then steals a boat for herself and Kelpie, which is revealed to be the only way to pass the barriers. She is confronted by Eredin Breacc Glas, whom is enraged by Auberon's death and tries to leave abruptly. A brief battle ensues, in which she injures Eredin and escapes to find the Ihuarraquax and co. waiting for her. Eredin and his riders soon find her, and a battle between the Dearg Ruadhri and the unicorns ensues. Ciri, in the midst of chaos, teleports out of the world with the assistance of Ihuarraquax.</p>

									<p>The story now follows Jarre, a monk that chooses to join the army which has formed due to the alliance between all of the Northern Kingdoms to propel the invading Nilfgaardian army. He meets up with several individuals, including characters seen earlier in the story, and joins a unit called the PFI, or "Poor Fucking Infantry."</p>

									<p>Ciri's story continues, where she is jumping between worlds and times in order to find her own, still running from Eredin and the Dearg Ruadhri. She eventually appears before the Lady of the Lake and Condwiramurs, who wish her luck on her journey as she leaves soon after.</p>

									<p>We continue with Jarre, where the armies of the Northern alliance and Nilfgaard have collided in a valley near the town of Brenna. The battle lasts hours, teetering the brink of victory and defeat several times. Elven units, led by Yaevinn, attack the flanks of the Northern army, go so far as to slaughter the injured in medical tents. As the Northern army finally starts to rout, a contingent of Redanian cavalry charge over a hill that was not scouted properly by the elves. This causes panic amongst the Nilfgaardian forces, which soon panic and are abruptly slaughtered. The commander of the Nilfgaardians, Coehoorn, is killed in an attempted escape. The battle is referred to as the Miracle at Brenna soon after. The Northern alliance soon push all Nilfgaardian forces south of the Yaruga, which served as the border, and a ceasefire is declared in order to make peace.</p>

									<p>Ciri is soon revealed to have gone to Vilgefortz's castle in order to save Yennefer herself, unable to find Geralt and knowing that Yennefer would die without her help. Ciri asks that Yennefer be released in exchange for herself, but Vilgefortz laughs and imprisons her anyway. Geralt arrives at the castle quickly after Ciri, not knowing that Ciri arrived earlier. Geralt and co. storm the castle, killing many of Skellen's men before Milva eventually dies. Geralt and Regis go to find Yennefer, whereas Cahir and Angouleme go to save Ciri once they learn she is here. Yennefer is saved by Geralt, who indiscriminately kills to save her. Bonhart frees Ciri, desiring to kill her in a fair fight. Ciri flees, and encounters Cahir, who fights Bonhart himself to save Ciri. Cahir is killed outright, and soon after Angouleme dies in the same manner. Ciri and Bonhart soon fight, with Ciri finally winning using the environment to her advantage. Ciri takes the three witcher medallions that Bonhart claimed to have taken off the corpses of witchers previously. Ciri runs to find Geralt and Yennefer.</p>

									<p>Meanwhile, Geralt, Regis, and Yennefer seek and fight Vilgefortz. Regis is obliterated in the fight, turning into a molten mass of dust. Geralt and Vilgefortz fight, with Geralt being victorious. Ciri eventually finds Geralt and Yennefer, who chose to go outside. On their way to the courtyard, they kill more of Skellen's men. As they reach the courtyard, they find the Emperor of Nilfgaard's men taking the castle and imprisoning any remaining men. The Emperor is revealed to be Ciri's father, and a long lost friend of Geralt. Geralt and Yennefer are told to commit suicide while Ciri is taken to the capital of Nilfgaard to be married to the Emperor. Geralt, without much of a choice, accepts, and Yennefer and Geralt take a bath together, with a dagger left in the room. Ciri eventually enters the room, saying that the Emperor's men left, without a word. The three soon leave, with Ciri leading the way to all of the places during her adventures earlier in the story. The three eventually return to Touissant, and save Dandelion from being executed. The four now split into two groups, Dandelion and Geralt heading to Rivia and Ciri and Yennefer going to meet with the sorceresses' Lodge.</p>

									<p>During Geralt's time in Rivia, a riot erupts, in which humans are killing non-humans indiscriminately. Geralt, in order to defend a couple of his dwarven friends he was in a pub with, enters the fray and kills several individuals before being impaled by a pitchfork. Ciri, Yennefer, and Triss Merigold arrive in Rivia shortly after the rioting starts, and they eventually find Geralt on the verge of death. Yennefer, in an attempt to revive him, passes out beside the witcher. Ihuarraquax shortly appears and channels her power through Ciri to heal Geralt and Yennefer. Ciri sends her trusted mare, Kelpie, with Ihuarraquax to their world. The rioting moves away from the area which they are at, and Ciri brings them out onto a nearby lake in a boat. While Triss, Dandelion, and their dwarven friends say their goodbyes, Ciri takes off into the lake which erupts into a light and the three disappear. Geralt and Yennefer awake in an unknown location, comforting each other.</p>

									<p>Ciri ends recounting her tale to Galahad, whom has been listening intently the entire time. Ciri sarcastically says that the tale ends with Yennefer and Geralt getting married, and that a celebration ensued between all the different dead and alive characters of the saga. Galahad eventually invites her to the court at Camelot, which she accepts. The saga ends with Ciri and Galahad riding side by side, holding hands.</p>

								<p>Season of Storms is the sixth Witcher novel and eighth overall book in the series written by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is not a follow-up to the spin-off of the Witcher series proper, but instead a midquel, set before "The Witcher" short story but after most of the other stories in The Last Wish.</p>
								<p>Geralt of Rivia is a Witcher, one of the few capable of hunting the monsters that prey on humanity. A mutant who is tasked with killing unnatural beings. He uses magical signs, potions, and the pride of every Witcher - two swords, steel and silver.</p>
								<p>But a contract has gone wrong, and Geralt finds himself without his signature weapons. Now he needs them back, because sorcerers are scheming, and across the world clouds are gathering.</p>

								<h3>Prologe</h3>
								<p>Geralt starts his adventure in the citadel of Kaer Morhen where bandits attack led by two shady characters, the Professor and a mysterious mage. The player eventually learns that they are part of a criminal organization called the Salamandra, and that they are after some special potions and equipment which were developed to genetically alter witchers to give them their powers. What they want with those potions is unclear.</p>

								<p>The chapter ends as the Professor and the mage teleport out of Kaer Morhen with the potions. The remaining witchers and allied characters decide to split up and search for information about the Salamandra to eventually stop them.</p>
								<h3>Chapter I</h3>
								<p>This chapter opens introducing Alvin, an unusual child whose path will repeatedly cross Geralt's. Hot on the trail of the mysterious men with Salamander badges, our witcher explores the outskirts of Vizima, where a terrifying beast harasses the villagers by night. The witcher encounters old friends (whom he doesn't recognize at first) and makes connections with locals while seeking a way into the city, even finding a hint or two about the fate of his fellow witcher Berengar. After striving to gain the trust of several prominent locals and perhaps dealing with a few less-than-prominent ones, Geralt manages to get through the Miller's Gate into Vizima proper - though not on his own terms…</p>
								<div id="g1more-t" class="story-text-more">
									<h3>Chapter II</h3>
									<p>Geralt now has access to the Temple Quarter, where he will have to solve a mystery. Who sends assassins after him? Who is involved with the Salamandra? Several influential people in the city are suspects, and Geralt has the help of the private investigator to sort through the clues and follow up on them.</p>

									<p>Note that Geralt no longer has access to the Outskirts in this chapter, but he gains access to the Temple Quarter, part of the Vizima sewers, the Vizima dike, the Vizima cemetery, and the Swamp.
									<h3>Chapter III</h3>
									<p>During Chapter III, Geralt will have to follow new leads on the Salamandra, while investigating the mysterious powers of the child Alvin whom he rescued in Chapter I. The Scoia'tael also start being more bold in their attempts.		</p>

									<h3>Chapter IV</h3>
									<p>Geralt now finds himself in a totally new area of Temeria, far from Vizima and cut off from most of the people he knew. Dandelion and Alvin are with him though, as is Abigail (if Geralt saves her from the villagers in Chapter I, otherwise the village healer is an old woman) and there are new intrigues around him. Depending on the choice made in Chapter I, the resolution to The Heat of the Day quest is different.</p>

									<p>The chapter ends with a showdown between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael, where Geralt must finally declare his chosen path and act accordingly.</p>

									<h3>Chapter V</h3>
									<p>Geralt does not escape the conflict between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael in Murky Waters but ends up having to fight both sides. But Vizima now burns, the conflict taking more and more casualties. Geralt meets some nurses who are trying to get to Shani at the field hospital. The witcher must then also help Shani get out of Old Vizima to the swamp cemetery to get medicine from the druids. At the same time, King Foltest returns and his daughter Adda seems to be having a relapse of the Striga curse. Geralt must do what he can for the princess, and in return, Foltest will divulge what he knows about the Salamandra hideout, and as a result, Azar Javed's location.</p>
									<h3>Epilogue</h3>
									<p>With Princess Adda's curse resolved, King Foltest and King Radovid of Redania forge an alliance. If Adda survives, Foltest agrees to give her hand in marriage to Radovid in exchange for Radovid's army's help in resolving the Order/Scoia'tael conflict. It is revealed that Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg was behind Salamandra all along, using it and Azar Javed to build an army of mutants, overthrow Foltest and take the throne. With Javed dead, the Grand Master will be expecting Geralt's visit...</p>

									<p>Foltest and Radovid agree to use their armies to attack the Order of the Flaming Rose. Geralt is given permission to eradicate the Grand Master and any of his servants.</p>

									<p>Geralt arrives back in the Temple Quarter with Triss Merigold and informs the king of his findings.</p>

									<p>Geralt and Triss confront Siegfried shortly after; Geralt chooses whether to kill or spare the knight.</p>

									<p>Geralt and Triss go to a shelter, where Golan Vivaldi, Vaska, the Hermit, and the novice nun have gathered. Vivaldi pities himself, stating that both the Order and the Scoia'tael loathe him. Vaska is unhappy about war spreading to her village. The Hermit states that he wanted to give advice to King Foltest, but did not arrive in time. The novice nun reminds Geralt of the prophecy of Ithlinne, stating that the world is near its end. Carmen is also there, if Geralt previously killed Vincent. In the cellar, Vetala and the resolute girl from the Lakeside idle. Geralt and Triss leave through the cellar, into a monster-infested basement. Upstairs from there, a madman advises them to exit through his window.</p>

									<p>Geralt meets Yaevinn outside and has the opportunity to kill or spare him, as with Siegfried earlier. More fighting occurs either way; then Triss says they must descend into the sewer. There is no wounded knight to give them a key - Triss has it already.</p>

									<p>After traveling through dire sewers and dispatching the zeugl, Geralt and Triss finally reach the cloister where the Grand Master resides. At this point, Geralt uses a ruse to ditch Triss so he can go on alone.</p>

									<p>From this point, no matter which path Geralt has chosen, he goes on alone. When Geralt finds the Grand Master, it is revealed that everything he has done was to save humanity from the inevitable "Great White Frost" (Ithlinne's Prophecy). All his life, he was plagued by visions of what the future of humanity would look like if nothing was done. His solution was simple: he would become their saviour.</p>

									<p>To achieve this, de Aldersberg had recently developed mutants known as Greater Brothers, who had all the strength and skill of a witcher, without the sentimentality. These mutants would shepherd Believers on an exodus to the south, thereby saving them from the dire predictions. Geralt quite rightly remarks at that point that every megalomaniac speaks of a "higher purpose". And with the help of the friends he has made during the course of the story, Geralt makes it through the Grand Master's vision and ends his plans.</p>

									<p>Geralt's final choice involves a demand from the King of the Wild Hunt for the Grand Master's soul.
									In the end, Geralt is seen accepting his reward for dispatching the Grand Master and his mutants. As the White Wolf nears the palace doors, he notices the corpses of the drowsy guards shown in the beginning of the cinematic. He draws his sword and rushes for the king's study, finding Foltest under attack by a lone assassin. A fight ensues between the Witcher and the unknown assailant, and the latter is starting to get the better of the former... until the newly acquired coin purse is used for a distraction, allowing Geralt to sever an arm. The would-be murderer is unmasked: it is an unfamiliar face... with very familiar eyes (witcher's eyes).</p>

								<p>The Prologue opens with Geralt in chains in the La Valette dungeon. He is soon dragged out for interrogation by Vernon Roche, leader of the Temerian Special Forces known as the Blue Stripes. We then learn that the witcher has been accused of killing King Foltest and it is up to him to convince Roche of his innocence. The rest of the prologue serves as a game tutorial as Geralt recounts the events leading up to the king's demise and his incarceration.</p>

								<p>While storming the castle with Foltest's men, Geralt must decide whether to force Aryan La Valette to surrender or kill him. If Aryan surrenders, Geralt must help him in the dungeon. If Aryan dies, then the witcher must help Aryan's mother, and Foltest's mistress, Mary Louisa La Valette.</p>

								<p>Geralt must then escape the dungeon and meet up with Roche and Triss. The trio then set off by boat for Flotsam.</p>
								
								<p>Having arrived near Flotsam, the last known location of Iorveth and his commandos. The witcher, accompanied by Roche and Triss, makes his way into town only to encounter Iorveth and his elves along the way. Triss manages to cast a protective spell but at some cost to herself...</p>
								<div id="g2more-t" class="story-text-more">
									<p>Upon arrival at their destination, the witcher finds two of his best friends, Dandelion and Zoltan, on the Flotsam scaffold, about to be hanged. He must negotiate their release by dealing with the local commandant, Bernard Loredo.</p>

									<p>While in town, Geralt learns that the port is menaced by a huge beast, the kayran. The beast must be dealt with before anyone can leave town. This is when the witcher meets another sorceress, Síle de Tansarville, who is also hunting the beast.</p>

									<p>Triss is kidnapped by Letho, so Geralt sets off to find her and the kingslayer, but he cannot go on alone, so he must decide between Roche and Iorveth.</p>
									
									<p>Having made his choice to follow either Vernon Roche or Iorveth, Geralt arrives in Aedirn, just in time for a battle between King Henselt's troops and the dwarven city of Vergen. Then depending on his alliance, he will either be based in the dwarven city itself, or in Henselt's army camp.</p>

									<p>While in Aedirn, the witcher either meets a third sorceress: Philippa Eilhart, or a sorcerer: Dethmold. Also, Geralt learns of a curse cast over the site of a battle three years prior. This curse must be lifted before he can proceed.</p>

									<p>Geralt finds news of Triss only to have her slip through his fingers once more, so he must continue his search for her and heads off to Loc Muinne where she is being taken by the Nilfgaardians.</p>
									
									<p>Several choices face Geralt in the final chapter of the game. If he has followed Iorveth this far, the witcher must decide whether to save Triss from the Nilfgaardians, or Philippa Eilhart from the Redanians. If he has followed Roche this far, then he must decide between Triss or saving Anaïs La Valette from the Kaedwenis.</p>

									<p>He is also faced with the dilemma of whether or not to kill a dragon.</p>
									
									<p>There're no actual quests in the Epilogue (besides the main "The Assassins of Kings" quest) and the main decision that you have to make is either kill Letho of Gulet, the kingslayer, or not.</p>

								<p>The opening cutscene depicts Yennefer fleeing some unknown danger in the midst of a large battle and Geralt and Vesemir several days later tracking her escape from various signs left in her wake. At the scene's conclusion the story officially starts with Geralt in a guest room at Kaer Morhen, the stronghold of the witchers in the Blue Mountains. After proceeding through brief tutorials on movement and combat mechanics, and the sudden and terrifying appearance of the Wild Hunt, we learn that the time Geralt is actually dreaming about the events at Kaer Morhen. Geralt awakes to discuss his dream with Vesemir and they resume their tracking of Yennefer's flight as seen in the opening scene.</p>

								<p>Vesemir and Geralt make their way to White Orchard where they learn that Yennefer was last seen speaking with the Nilfgaardian captain before she raced off. The captain agrees to tell Geralt where Yennefer went in exchange for ridding the town of a griffin that has recently been attacking villagers on the main road. Geralt examines the beast's nest and sets a trap for the griffin and with the help of Vesemir soon defeats the griffin. The nilfgaardian captain says that Yennefer has rode on to Vizima. Just as Geralt and Vesemir are about to depart they are approached by none other than Yennefer herself. Yennefer insists that Geralt follow her back to Vizima for an audience with the emperor Emhyr var Emreis. Vesemir decides it would be best if he returned to Kaer Morhen...</p>
								<div id="g3more-t" class="story-text-more">
									<p>Even when crossing the short distance between White Orchard and Vizma, Geralt and Yennefer cannot have a quiet moment as they are soon set upon by hounds of The Wild Hunt. Fortunately for our hero no harm comes to either Geralt or Yennefer and they arrive safely in Vizima where Emperor Emhyr enlists Geralt's aid in finding the emperor's daughter Ciri who is believed to have the Wild Hunt closing in on her. Geralt agrees to help and meets with Yennefer to formulate a plan. Geralt intends to begin his search in Velen and meet with Triss Merigold to join forces in the search. Meanwhile, Yennefer departs to investigate a magical disturbance in Skellige that might be linked to Ciri.</p>
									
									<p>Geralt finds himself traveling the road alone now in No Man's Land, also known as Velen, a region devastated by the war between the Nilfgaardian Empire and the Northern Kingdoms. Geralt can choose to begin his search here by seeking out emperor Emhyr's spy, Hendrik located in nearby Heatherton. Upon reaching the small village it is immediately clear that something evil has visited this town beyond the normal destruction caused by warring nations. From the clues the Witcher is able to gather from what is left of the now deceased spy's notes two possible leads on Ciri's whereabouts are deduced.</p>

									<p>The first clue is that Ciri met with the local warlord and now de facto ruler of Velen, Phillip Strenger nicknamed the Bloody Baron. Seeking out this self-proclaimed ruler enthroned at nearby Crow's Perch, Geralt must trade with the Baron his own time and skill locating the a missing wife and daughter in exchange for information about where Ciri may have gone. This seemingly simple task for someone as skilled as a witcher will take Geralt all over Velen and even into the city of nearby Novigrad. The stresses of alcoholism, infidelity, abuse and warfare combine to form a predictably poor outcome for the Baron and his family and leaves the Witcher having to make several difficult decisions between greater and lesser evils.</p>

									<p>The other lead Geralt may follow is a note that a woman fitting Ciri's description was seen to have quarreled with a witch. The people of Velen being very superstitious folk, a witch could mean anything from a local healer to a powerful sorceress, leaving not much to go on at first. In fact, the Witcher's first witch encounter turns out to be the wrong witch, when he finds Keira Metz living nearby the village of Midcopse. Long time friends, off and on lovers, the two team up to search for a mysterious elven mage whom Keira claims may have been helping Ciri. Unfortunately The Wild Hunt reaches the mage's underground cave first and the resulting fight and search of the caverns under The Mire yields little to no info about Ciri's whereabouts. Before leaving Keira suggests Geralt investigate Crookback Bog a location known to be home to a trio of Crones, maybe the witches that Ciri was heard to have tangled with. Geralt's investigation in the bog and meetings with its residents has a surprising tie-in with the Baron's search for his family and is overshadowed by an epic struggle, between the powerful Crones and a mysterious spirit, on which the lives of many depend.</p>

									<p>All clues in Velen exhausted, Geralt continues on to Novigrad, relying on the Baron's last memories of Ciri saying she would ride there and seek shelter from The Wild Hunt that sought her.</p>
									
									<p>Geralt must muster additional forces for the forthcoming battle in Kaer Morhen with the forces of the Wild Hunt. Geralt takes on several tasks to bolster his allies before the coming battle. The aftermath of the attack is also presented, too.</p>
									
									<p>Geralt's path comes to a close, and the decisions you made throughout the adventure come back to help (or haunt) you.</p>
